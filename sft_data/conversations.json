In SFT, the model is trained on pairs of prompts and desired responses. The process involves taking a pre-trained model and further training it on high-quality examples of the desired behavior, which helps the model learn to generate responses that match the expected output format and content quality. This approach is commonly used to create instruction-following models from general language models."

Typing: Python is strongly typed but dynamically typed, while JavaScript is weakly and dynamically typed.\n\n4. Execution: Python is typically executed by an interpreter, while JavaScript runs in browsers or through Node.js.\n\n5. Concurrency: JavaScript uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model with callbacks and promises, while Python traditionally uses threads and processes (though it also supports async/await).\n\n6. Libraries: Python has extensive libraries for scientific computing and data analysis, while JavaScript has a rich ecosystem for web development."

Forward process: Starting with real data (like an image), random noise is gradually added in multiple steps until the data becomes pure noise.\n\n2. Reverse process (denoising): The model learns to predict the noise that was added at each step, allowing it to gradually denoise and reconstruct the original data.\n\n3. Training: The model is trained to predict the noise component at each step of the forward process.\n\n4. Generation: To generate new data, you start with pure noise and run the reverse process, gradually denoising to create a new sample.\n\nDiffusion models have been particularly successful in image generation (like DALL-E and Stable Diffusion) and are now being applied to other domains including text generation, as seen in LLaDA which applies diffusion concepts to language modeling."

Decoders use masked self-attention, where each token can only attend to previous tokens (to prevent looking ahead during generation).\n\n2. Cross-attention: Decoders have an additional cross-attention layer that attends to the encoder's output, while encoders don't have this component.\n\n3. Usage: Encoders are typically used for understanding tasks (like classification or feature extraction) where the entire input is available at once. Decoders are used for generation tasks where outputs are produced sequentially.\n\n4. Information flow: Encoders process all input tokens in parallel, while decoders generate output tokens one by one (autoregressive generation).\n\n5. Applications: Encoder-only models include BERT and RoBERTa, decoder-only models include GPT and LLaMA, and encoder-decoder models include T5 and BART."

Early work on convolutional neural networks by Yann LeCun.\n\n2000s: Advancements in ensemble methods like Random Forests and practical applications of machine learning in various industries.\n\n2010s: Deep learning revolution, triggered by AlexNet's success in the ImageNet competition (2012). Development of transformative architectures like Transformers (2017).\n\n2020s: Emergence of massive language models like GPT, BERT, and LLaMA, multimodal models, and diffusion models, pushing the boundaries of AI capabilities across domains."

Generation Process: \n   - Autoregressive models generate text token-by-token from left to right\n   - LLaDA uses a diffusion-inspired approach where it starts with masked tokens and iteratively refines them in parallel\n\n3. Masking Strategy: LLaDA employs a mask predictor that predicts all masked tokens simultaneously, then strategically remasks some tokens based on confidence or random selection.\n\n4. Parallelism: LLaDA can generate multiple tokens in parallel during each step, potentially offering faster generation compared to strictly autoregressive models.\n\n5. Training Objective: While autoregressive models predict the next token given previous tokens, LLaDA is trained to predict masked tokens given surrounding context (similar to BERT but with a diffusion-based approach).\n\n6. Sampling Process: LLaDA uses a multi-step denoising process where tokens are gradually revealed and refined, rather than the one-pass left-to-right generation of autoregressive models.\n\nThis approach combines benefits of both masked language models and autoregressive models while introducing the iterative refinement concept from diffusion models."
